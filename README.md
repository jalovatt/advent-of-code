# Advent of Code

My solutions/attempts for the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) coding challenge.

I won't claim to have solved all of these without assistance.

## Usage

This repo uses Yarn 2, Typescript, and Jest.

1. Clone the repo.
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn test` - run all of the tests
4. `yarn test 2021/23` - run a specific day
5. `yarn day 21` - copy the template to a new folder for day 21 of the current calendar year, open that day's puzzle page and input, and start `yarn test` in watch mode.
6. `yarn day 2015 21` - as above, but for a specific year.
